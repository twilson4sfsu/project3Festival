The approach for this project came to me basically as soon as the prompt was introduced. One of my favorite bands, King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, who also happen to make music about environmental issues and take strides towards sustainability seemed to me as a perfect fit for a festival about social justice.
From there, I decided the issue to tackle with my festival was going to be centered around cleaning up the ocean of plastic waste (which is the second most littered thing behind cigarette butts) and I took the name of the festival from a King Gizzard song of the same name.
Next I went all in on developing the visual branding of the website, starting with the striking header image which combines many visual references to KGLW's discography placed into the background of the San Francisco Bay Area.
Overall, the layout of the site was limited to what I knew how to do in HTML/CSS and how much time I left for myself which was not much due to my procrastination. As a result, the finished product is not as visually robust as I think it should have been but still looks presentable in my opinion.
